    <p>Are you looking to employ someone who can build dynamic and interactive websites? Or are you looking for someone you can regularly subcontract your web work to? If so, then this website is for you. So, browse the site and see if my skills are what your organisation needs.</p>
    <p>My name is Gregor Brabyn and I program using <b>PHP</b> and <b>JavaScript</b>. I know SQL and use the <b>MySQL</b> and <b>PostgreSQL</b> databases. I am also completely familiar with HTML and CSS.</p>
    <p>With my knowledge of <b>search engine optimisation</b> (SEO) I am well aware of how a website's structure influences its ability to rank well with search engines. As your developer I will build websites structured so that your SEO specialist can achieve optimum results.</p>
    <p>As you are well aware, there is much more to building websites than just these skills. There is also website usability, accessibility, information architecture, copywriting, visitor tracking analysis, conversion rate optimisation, hosting arrangements and more. My broad knowledge covers these areas.</p>
    <p>Maybe you are also looking for a website developer who can competently manage their projects and liaise with clients. Here I bring you skills and experience in <b>managing projects</b> from beginning to end. This includes defining requirements with client, quoting/cost estimates, coding, coordinating other people in the project, testing, making live and gaining client feedback.</p>
    <p>This website is designed to give you an insight into my areas of expertise. Please browse the site and if you have any questions feel free to contact me.</p>
